**List of playlist-cards:** A list of playlists mainly derived from `playlistIds` or through [DATA-API](https://developers.dailymotion.com/api/#playlist).

    2. With list of `VIDEO_ID`. Example :
    `data-list-2 = "My Selected videos=video_ids(x85xvf0,x85xurb,x85xtvb)"`
    > You must use `","` separator to add more `{VIDEO_ID}`
    3. With [dailymotion DATA-API](https://developers.dailymotion.com/api/#video). Example :
    `data-list-3 = "My Trending Videos=video_api(sort=trending)"`
    >  You can customized title as here `My Trending Videos`.

2. To embed `List of playlist-cards`, you can use two ways based on requirements.

### To Add Category and City :

Dailymotion Video Tiles also provide an option to add categories and cities through `application/json` `script` tag. You must add this `script` tag before main `script` i.e., [dm-video-tiles.min.js](https://srvr.dmvs-apac.com/dm-video-tiles/dm-video-tiles.min.js). Example : 

```html
<script type="application/json" id="dm_video_tiles">
    {
        "category": [
            {
                "name": "News",
                "playlist": "`PLAYLIST_ID`,`PLAYLIST_ID`"
            },
            {
                "name": "Entertainment",
                "playlist": "`PLAYLIST_ID`,`PLAYLIST_ID`"
            }
        ],
        "city": [
            {
                "name": "Hello Pune",
                "playlist": "`PLAYLIST_ID`"
            },
            {
                "name": "Hello Mumbai",
                "playlist": "`PLAYLIST_ID}`"
            },
        ]
    }
</script>
```
For each category, you can map multiple playlists with `PLAYLIST_ID`. For each city, you can map a single playlist with `PLAYLIST_ID`. Like the Example â‡§ .


### Embed a preview of Video Tiles:

Assuming that you have already a `video-hub` page created by Dailymotion video tiles, You can add a preview of the `video-hub` on a different page of your website. The preview will show a snapshot of the `video-hub` which can be clicked to open the `video-hub` in a different tab. Example Embed code:

```html
    <div class="dm-video-tiles"
        playerId="{PLAYER_ID}"
        owners="{YOUR_CHANNEL_NAME}"
        videoTilesPreview="true"
        videoTilesLink="video-hub.html"
        data-list-1 = "=video_playlist(x5nune)" 
    >
    </div>
```
> Just add one `data-list-1` which will be used to show the preview.

### Customize Your Header: 

Dailymotion video tiles create its header with the given `logoImg`, `Category` and `City`. But it can be customized if you set `customHeader` `true`. Adding this param, Dailymotion video tiles will trigger a CustomEvent(`tiles-header-render`) on the `document` after creating a container(`div`) of the header.

The `tiles-header-render` event conveys information and method which can be used to customize the header.

Example code:
```js
    // On header create get info
    document.addEventListener("tiles-header-render",(e)=>{
        let dmTilesObj = e.detail
        /**
         * dmTilesObj = {
         *  headerDom : {Header Dom object}
         *  singleLive : { //If there is one live video
         *                  thumbnail_240_url: string;
                            title: string;
                            id: string;
                            created_time: number;
                            duration: number;
                            url: string;
                            "owner.screenname": string;
                            "owner.username": string;
                            channel: string;
                            onair: boolean;
         *               } or null
            isMobile: {true if its mobile},
            updateUrl : { funtion to route category or city page}
                        (
                            name:string,value:{pageName&playlistId}
                        )

         * }
         */
    })
```
As seen above the code, `dmTilesObj` is an object of information and method. These are

1. **headerDom** : It is container of the header, precisely a `HTMLElement` `div` object.
2. **singleLive** : If there is a single live video currently `onair`, it will be an object of that video's information.
3. **isMobile** : It wil be `true` for mobile.
4. **updateUrl(name:`string`,value:`{pageName&playlistId}`)** : This is the funtion to route the different page.
    1. **name:`string`** : you can set to `category` or `city` to route the category/city page accordingly.
    2. **value:`{pageName&playlistId}`)** : This is a combination of `category`'s/`city`'s name and its playlist.
    Ex:
    ```js
        // for category
        dmTilesObj.updateUrl({
            name: "category",
            value: "News"+"&"+"`PLAYLIST_ID`,`PLAYLIST_ID`,`PLAYLIST_ID`"
        });
        // for city
        dmTilesObj.updateUrl({
            name: "city",
            value: "Hello Pune"+"&"+"`PLAYLIST_ID`"
        });
    ```
